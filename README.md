# Friendly-Poistring
The easy way to get into poistring

# Getting Started
1. Download visual studio community (NOT VISUAL STUDIO CODE) https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ (if you have not already)
3. Make sure you have ".NET Desktop Development" installed, if you are not sure find visual studio installer on your system, click modify next to your installation and check the box is ticked next to .NET Desktop Development
4. While that is downloading download this repo as a zip, up top the green code button click that then download zip
5. Extract the zip you just downloaded into a folder anywhere you like
6. Once visual studio is ready go into the folder you extracted friendly poistring into and open the .sln (visual studio solution) file with visual studio
7. On the right hand side in visual studio there will be a program.cs file (if you dont see this refer to troubleshooting down below), read the code and comments, this will explain hopefully all you need to use poistring
- To run your code click the start button up the top of visual studio
- To change which code example you are running change the example on line 23
- you can either edit an existing example or duplicate one and give it a new name then change the example running to run your own procedure

# Troubleshooting 
- If in step 6 you dont see program.cs you may not have the solution explorer open, to open the solution explorer go to the top of visual studio select view then solution explorer
- If you are still having issues after CAREFULLY reading this guide find me in the A Township Tale server, yep thats me the spoooooky yellow name with the name poi (or something like that)

If you are a developer and want to intergrate poistring in your project you can get the latest dll from https://github.com/officialpoiuytrewq4645/Poistring
